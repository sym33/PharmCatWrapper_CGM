It may be reasonable to apply amitriptyline recommendation to other TCAs also metabolized by CYP2C19 including clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine. There are fewer clinical and pharmacokinetic data supporting dose adjustments for these drugs when compared to amitriptyline or nortriptyline (Supplemental Tables S8-S16). \r\n\r\n^d^ CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status frequencies are based on average multi-ethnic frequencies.

The currently available evidence indicates that the CYP2C19*17 increased function allele is unable to completely compensate for the CYP2C19*2 no function allele.\r\n\r\n## May 2013\r\n\r\nGuidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing for tricyclic antidepressants have been published in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics by the [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)](https://cpicpgx.org/).\r\n\r\n__Download:__ [article]( https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447.pdf) and [supplement]( https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447-supplement.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### Excerpt from the dosing guidelines:\r\n\r\n[Amitriptyline](http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA448385) and nortriptyline are used as model drugs for this guideline because the majority of pharmacogenomic studies have focused on these two drugs. Because the tricyclics have comparable pharmacokinetic properties, it may be reasonable to apply this [guideline](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447.pdf) to other tricyclics including clomipramine ([Supplementary Table S14](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447-supplement.pdf)), with the acknowledgement that there are fewer data supporting dose adjustments for these drugs than for amitriptyline or nortriptyline.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee [amitriptyline](http://www.pharmgkb.org/drug/PA448385) for excerpts and tables that summarize _CYP2D6_-based and _CYP2C19_-based dosing recommendations for amitriptyline when higher initial starting doses are warranted ([article](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2013/23486447.pdf)).",

Dosing recommendations only apply to higher initial doses of TCAs for treatment of conditions such as depression._\r\n\r\n__For the combination of a no function CYP2D6 allele and more than two copies of a normal function CYP2D6 allele AND CYP2C19 Ultrarapid metabolizer:__\r\n\r\nThe dosing recommendations are based on studies focusing on amitriptyline. Because tricyclic antidepressants have comparable pharmacokinetic properties, it may be reasonable to apply these guidelines to other tertiary amines including clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine and trimipramine. \r\n\r\n__Avoid TCA use.__\r\n\r\n_If TCAs are warranted, utilize therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustment. Utilizing therapeutic drug monitoring if a tricyclic is prescribed to a patient with CYP2D6 ultrarapid, intermediate or poor metabolism in combination with CYP2C19 ultrarapid, intermediate or poor metabolism is strongly recommended. Dosing recommendations only apply to higher initial doses of TCAs for treatment of conditions such as depression._",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with one decreased function allele and one no function allele are categorized as “likely poor metabolizers” (e.g. CYP2C19*2/*9). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies.

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with one decreased function allele and one no function allele are categorized as “likely poor metabolizers” (e.g. CYP2C19*2/*9). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely poor” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data._",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with two decreased function alleles OR patients with one normal or increased function allele AND one decreased function allele are categorized as “likely intermediate metabolizers” (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*9, *9/*9, *9/*17). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely intermediate” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data.</em></p>\n",

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with two decreased function alleles OR patients with one normal or increased function allele AND one decreased function allele are categorized as “likely intermediate metabolizers” (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*9, *9/*9, *9/*17). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely intermediate” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data._",
