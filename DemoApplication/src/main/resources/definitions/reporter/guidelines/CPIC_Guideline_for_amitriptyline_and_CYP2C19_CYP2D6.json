Modifying pharmacotherapy for patients who have _CYP2D6_ or _CYP2C19_ genomic variants that affect drug efficacy and safety could potentially improve clinical outcomes and reduce the failure rate of initial treatment.\"\r\n  - \" There are scarce studies focusing solely on _CYP2D6_ or _CYP2C19_ genotype and association with pharmacokinetic parameters or treatment outcomes of TCAs in pediatric patients. CYP2D6 activity is fully mature by early childhood, but CYP2C19 activity may be increased in children relative to adults. Although further genomic ontogeny studies are needed, there is a lack of evidence suggesting that this guideline cannot be extrapolated to pediatric patients.\" \r\n- The guideline includes dosing recommendation for amitriptyline based on:\r\n  - CYP2D6 phenotype ([Table 1 below](#table-1-dosing-recommendations-for-amitriptyline-based-on-cyp2d6-phenotype)) \r\n  - CYP2C19 phenotype ([Table 2 below](#table-2-dosing-recommendations-for-amitriptyline-based-on-cyp2c19-phenotype))\r\n  - combinations of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 phenotypes ([Table 3 below](#table-3-dosing-recommendations-for-amitriptyline-based-on-both-cyp2d6-and-cyp2c19-phenotype))\r\n- Download and read:  \r\n  - [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and dosing of tricyclic antidepressants: 2016 Update](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2016/TCA_2016.pdf) \r\n  - [2016 supplement](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2016/TCA_Supplement_2016.pdf)\r\n  - [CYP2D6 Gene-specific Information Tables](https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2d6RefMaterials)\r\n  - [CYP2C19 Gene-specific Information Tables](https://www.pharmgkb.org/page/cyp2c19RefMaterials)\r\n  - [Amitriptyline Drug Resource Mappings](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2016/Amitriptyline_Drug_Resource_Mappings.xlsx) \r\n  - [Amitriptyline Pre and Post Test Alerts and Flow Chart](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/TCA/2016/Amitriptyline_Pre_and_Post_Test_Alerts_and_Flow_Chart.xlsx)\r\n\r\n## Table 1: Dosing recommendations for amitriptyline based on CYP2D6 phenotype:\r\n\r\n_Adapted from Tables 1 and 2 of the 2016 guideline update._\r\n\r\n| Likely phenotype | Activity score | Genotypes | Examples of diplotypes | Implications | Therapeutic Recommendations^a, b^ | Classification of recommendation for amitriptyline and nortriptyline^c^ |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| CYP2D6 Ultrarapid metabolizer (~1-20% of patients)^d^ | >2.0 | An individual carrying more than two copies of functional alleles | *1/*1xN, *1/*2xN | Increased metabolism of TCAs to less active compounds compared to normal metabolizers.

Therefore, for the purpose of this guideline the following assignments have been proposed: patients with two decreased function alleles OR patients with one normal or increased function allele AND one decreased function allele are categorized as “likely intermediate metabolizers” (e.g., CYP2C19*1/*9, *9/*9, *9/*17). For many rare alleles, no information regarding enzyme activity is currently available, and those with functional data have only been determined by in vitro studies. Consequently, the proposed “likely intermediate” metabolizer assignments were developed for diplotypes that contain one allele with an established effect on enzyme activity and a second allele with limited or no available activity data._",

    "summary" : "CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms affect the exposure, efficacy and safety of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with some drugs being affected by CYP2D6 only (e.g., nortriptyline and desipramine) and others by both polymorphic enzymes (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine). Evidence is presented for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype-directed dosing of TCAs. This document is an update to the 2012 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Tricyclic Antidepressants.
