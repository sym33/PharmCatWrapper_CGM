Literature up to Dec 2016 was reviewed, recommendations and supplemental information were updated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Excerpt from the 2017 dosing guideline update:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<strong><em>Therapeutic Recommendations: Adults</em></strong><br />\nNumerous studies have derived warfarin dosing algorithms that use both genetic and non-genetic factors to predict warfarin dose [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/18305455\">18305455</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/19228618\">19228618</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/20375999\">20375999</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/22012312\">22012312</a>]. Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/18305455\">18305455</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/19228618\">19228618</a>] and were created using more than 5,000 subjects, though as noted above, more recent data suggest they do not perform acceptably in African Americans when used without modification for CYP2C9 alleles frequently found in the African population [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/24251361\">24251361</a>].  The Gage and IWPC algorithms or minor adjustments to them have also been the algorithms used in both randomized controlled trials and most of the prospective dosing studies.  Dosing algorithms using genetic information outperform non-genetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction, except in African Americans when the algorithm only includes CYP2C9*2 and *3 [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/18305455\">18305455</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/19228618\">19228618</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/24251361\">24251361</a>]. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/21272753\">21272753</a>].</p>\n<p><strong><em>Pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing</em></strong>:  This guideline recommends that pharmacogenetic warfarin dosing be accomplished through the use of one of the pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms described above, as summarized in <a href=\"#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients\">Figure 2</a>.  The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations...It is important to note that these algorithms do not include CYP4F2, CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, or *11 or rs12777823, and incorporation of these should be added when results are available, as described in <a href=\"#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients\">Figure 2</a>.  The warfarindosing.org website contains both algorithms, the Gage algorithm [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/18305455\">18305455</a>] as the primary algorithm and the IWPC algorithm [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/19228618\">19228618</a>] as the secondary algorithm and can adjust for CYP4F2, CYP2C9*5 and *6.  If utilizing warfarindosing.org, the user should be clear on whether the algorithm is or is not incorporating genotypes beyond CYP2C9 *2 and *3 and VKORC1, which are the only three genotypes in the original version of both algorithms.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Non-African ancestry recommendation</em></strong>. In patients who self-identify as non-African ancestry, the recommendation, as summarized in <a href=\"#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients\">Figure 2</a>, is to:  1) calculate warfarin dosing using a published pharmacogenetic algorithm [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/18305455\">18305455</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/19228618\">19228618</a>], including genotype information for VKORC1-1639G&gt;A and CYP2C9*2 and *3. In individuals with genotypes associated with CYP2C9 poor metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9 *2/*3, *3/*3) or both increased sensitivity (VKORC1-1639 A/A) and CYP2C9 poor metabolism, an alternative oral anticoagulant might be considered. These recommendations are graded as STRONG.  2) If a loading dose is to be utilized, the EU-PACT loading dose algorithm that incorporates genetic information could be used [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/24251363\">24251363</a>].  This recommendation is OPTIONAL. 3) While CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, or*11 variant alleles are commonly referred to as African specific alleles, they can occur among individuals who do not identify as, or know of their, African ancestry.  If these variant alleles are detected, decrease calculated dose by 15-30% per variant allele or consider an alternative agent. Larger dose reductions might be needed in patients homozygous for variant alleles (i.e. 20-40%, e.g. CYP2C9*2/*5). This recommendation is graded as OPTIONAL.  4) If the CYP4F2*3 (i.e., c.1297A, p.433Met) allele is also detected, increase the dose by 5-10%.  This recommendation is also considered OPTIONAL.   5) The data do not suggest an association between rs12777823 genotype and warfarin dose in non-African Americans, thus rs12777823 should not be considered in these individuals (even if available).</p>\n<p><strong><em>African ancestry recommendation</em></strong>. In patients of African ancestry, CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, *11 are important for warfarin dosing. If these genotypes are not available, warfarin should be dosed clinically without consideration for genotype. If CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, and *11 are known, then the recommendation, as shown in  <a href=\"#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients\">Figure 2</a>, is to: 1) calculate warfarin dose using a validated pharmacogenetic algorithm, including genotype information for VKORC1 c.-1639G&gt;A and CYP2C9*2 and *3 [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/18305455\">18305455</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/19228618\">19228618</a>]; 2) if the individual carriers a CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, or *11 variant allele(s), decrease calculated dose by 15-30%. Larger dose reductions might be needed in patients who carry two variant alleles (e.g., CYP2C9*5/*6) (i.e. 20-40% dose reduction). 3) In addition, rs12777823 is associated with warfarin dosing in African Americans (mainly originating from West Africa). Thus, in African Americans a dose reductions of 10-25% in those with rs12777823 A/G or A/A genotype is recommended.  These recommendations are considered MODERATE.   In individuals with genotypes that predict CYP2C9 poor metabolism or who have increased warfarin sensitivity (VKORC1 c.-1639 A/A) and CYP2C9 poor metabolism, an alternative oral anticoagulant should be considered.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;<strong><em>Therapeutic Recommendations: Pediatric</em></strong><br />\nIn children of European ancestry and if CYP2C9*2 and *3 and VKORC1-1639 genotype are available, calculate warfarin dosing based on a validated published pediatric pharmacogenetic algorithm (<a href=\"#figure-3-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-pediatric-patients\">Figure 3</a>) [Articles:<a href=\"/pmid/22010099\">22010099</a>, <a href=\"/pmid/23307232\">23307232</a>].

The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Approach to pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing without access to dosing algorithms:     In 2007, the FDA modified the warfarin label, stating that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes may be useful in determining the optimal initial dose of warfarin [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/17906972\">17906972</a>]. The label was further updated in 2010 to include a table (Table 1) describing recommendations for initial dosing ranges for patients with different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table [Article:<a href=\"/pmid/21272753\">21272753</a>]. Therefore, the use of pharmacogenetic algorithm-based dosing is recommended when possible, although if electronic means for such dosing are not available, the table-based dosing approaches (Table 1) are suggested.

      "markdown" : "## February 2017 Update\r\n\r\n- The 2017 update of CPIC guidelines regarding the use of pharmacogenomic tests in dosing of warfarin is published in [_Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics_](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.668/abstract) by the _Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium_ [(CPIC)](https://cpicpgx.org).  Literature up to Dec 2016 was reviewed, recommendations and supplemental information were updated.\r\n- Excerpt from the 2017 dosing guideline update:\r\n\r\n  - \"___Therapeutic Recommendations: Adults___  \r\n      Numerous studies have derived warfarin dosing algorithms that use both genetic and non-genetic factors to predict warfarin dose [PMID: 18305455, 19228618, 20375999, 22012312]. Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose [PMID: 18305455, 19228618] and were created using more than 5,000 subjects, though as noted above, more recent data suggest they do not perform acceptably in African Americans when used without modification for CYP2C9 alleles frequently found in the African population [PMID:24251361].  The Gage and IWPC algorithms or minor adjustments to them have also been the algorithms used in both randomized controlled trials and most of the prospective dosing studies.  Dosing algorithms using genetic information outperform non-genetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction, except in African Americans when the algorithm only includes CYP2C9*2 and *3 [PMID: 18305455, 19228618, 24251361]. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table [PMID: 21272753].    \r\n\r\n      ___Pharmacogenetic algorithm-based warfarin dosing___:  This guideline recommends that pharmacogenetic warfarin dosing be accomplished through the use of one of the pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms described above, as summarized in [Figure 2](#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients).  The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations...It is important to note that these algorithms do not include CYP4F2, CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, or *11 or rs12777823, and incorporation of these should be added when results are available, as described in [Figure 2](#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients).  The warfarindosing.org website contains both algorithms, the Gage algorithm [PMID: 18305455] as the primary algorithm and the IWPC algorithm [PMID: 19228618] as the secondary algorithm and can adjust for CYP4F2, CYP2C9*5 and *6.  If utilizing warfarindosing.org, the user should be clear on whether the algorithm is or is not incorporating genotypes beyond CYP2C9 *2 and *3 and VKORC1, which are the only three genotypes in the original version of both algorithms.     \r\n\r\n     ___Non-African ancestry recommendation___. In patients who self-identify as non-African ancestry, the recommendation, as summarized in [Figure 2](#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients), is to:  1) calculate warfarin dosing using a published pharmacogenetic algorithm [PMID: 18305455, 19228618], including genotype information for VKORC1-1639G>A and CYP2C9*2 and *3. In individuals with genotypes associated with CYP2C9 poor metabolism (e.g., CYP2C9 *2/*3, *3/*3) or both increased sensitivity (VKORC1-1639 A/A) and CYP2C9 poor metabolism, an alternative oral anticoagulant might be considered. These recommendations are graded as STRONG.  2) If a loading dose is to be utilized, the EU-PACT loading dose algorithm that incorporates genetic information could be used [PMID: 24251363].  This recommendation is OPTIONAL. 3) While CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, or*11 variant alleles are commonly referred to as African specific alleles, they can occur among individuals who do not identify as, or know of their, African ancestry.  If these variant alleles are detected, decrease calculated dose by 15-30% per variant allele or consider an alternative agent. Larger dose reductions might be needed in patients homozygous for variant alleles (i.e. 20-40%, e.g. CYP2C9*2/*5). This recommendation is graded as OPTIONAL.  4) If the CYP4F2*3 (i.e., c.1297A, p.433Met) allele is also detected, increase the dose by 5-10%.  This recommendation is also considered OPTIONAL.   5) The data do not suggest an association between rs12777823 genotype and warfarin dose in non-African Americans, thus rs12777823 should not be considered in these individuals (even if available).      \r\n\r\n     ___African ancestry recommendation___. In patients of African ancestry, CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, *11 are important for warfarin dosing. If these genotypes are not available, warfarin should be dosed clinically without consideration for genotype. If CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, and *11 are known, then the recommendation, as shown in  [Figure 2](#figure-2-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-adult-patients), is to: 1) calculate warfarin dose using a validated pharmacogenetic algorithm, including genotype information for VKORC1 c.-1639G>A and CYP2C9*2 and *3 [PMID: 18305455, 19228618]; 2) if the individual carriers a CYP2C9*5, *6, *8, or *11 variant allele(s), decrease calculated dose by 15-30%. Larger dose reductions might be needed in patients who carry two variant alleles (e.g., CYP2C9*5/*6) (i.e. 20-40% dose reduction). 3) In addition, rs12777823 is associated with warfarin dosing in African Americans (mainly originating from West Africa). Thus, in African Americans a dose reductions of 10-25% in those with rs12777823 A/G or A/A genotype is recommended.  These recommendations are considered MODERATE.   In individuals with genotypes that predict CYP2C9 poor metabolism or who have increased warfarin sensitivity (VKORC1 c.-1639 A/A) and CYP2C9 poor metabolism, an alternative oral anticoagulant should be considered.\"  \r\n\r\n  - \"___Therapeutic Recommendations: Pediatric___  \r\n     In children of European ancestry and if CYP2C9*2 and *3 and VKORC1-1639 genotype are available, calculate warfarin dosing based on a validated published pediatric pharmacogenetic algorithm ([Figure 3](#figure-3-dosing-recommendations-for-warfarin-dosing-based-on-genotype-for-pediatric-patients)) [PMID: 22010099, 23307232].

These papers have prompted several opinion pieces [PMID: 24328463, 24251364].

Two algorithms perform well in estimating stable warfarin dose across different ethnic populations; [PMID: 18305455, 19228618] these were created using more than 5,000 subjects. Dosing algorithms using genetics outperform nongenetic clinical algorithms and fixed-dose approaches in dose prediction [PMID: 18305455, 19228618]. The best way to estimate the anticipated stable dose of warfarin is to use the algorithms available on [http://www.warfarindosing.org] (offering both high-performing algorithms [PMID: 18305455, 19228618]). The dosing algorithm published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium is also online, at [IWPC Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithm](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/IWPC_dose_calculator.xls). The two algorithms provide very similar dose recommendations.\"\r\n  - \"Approach to pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing without access to dosing algorithms:     In 2007, the FDA modified the warfarin label, stating that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes may be useful in determining the optimal initial dose of warfarin [PMID:17906972]. The label was further updated in 2010 to include a table (Table 1) describing recommendations for initial dosing ranges for patients with different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes. Genetics-based algorithms also better predict warfarin dose than the FDA-approved warfarin label table [PMID:21272753]. Therefore, the use of pharmacogenetic algorithm-based dosing is recommended when possible, although if electronic means for such dosing are not available, the table-based dosing approaches (Table 1) are suggested. The range of doses by VKORC1 genotype and the range of dose recommendations/predictions by the FDA table and algorithm are shown in Figure 2.\"\r\n- Download and read: \r\n  - [Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guidelines for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes and warfarin dosing](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/21900891.pdf)\r\n  - [2011 supplement](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/21900891-supplement.pdf)\r\n  - Look up your warfarin dosing guideline using the [IWPC Pharmacogenetic Dosing Algorithm](https://github.com/PharmGKB/cpic-guidelines/raw/master/warfarin/2011/IWPC_dose_calculator.xls).\r\n\r\n## Figure 2.
